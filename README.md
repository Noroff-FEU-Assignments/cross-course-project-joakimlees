# CMS-CA

This is the CMS CA submission of this repo.

Previously there have been updates for:

- html and css CA
- interaction design CA.

## CMS CA changes

Instead of using the jackets-array.js a REST-API have been made using wordpress. Fetching the api using javascript.
added try catch blocks for errors and a loading indicator.

The variable names have changes slightly as the api since the structure of this rest api was different from the jackets-array previously made.
beside that the codes remaind pretty much the same.

Since i used local storage and data-attributes in interaction design CA to store and display data/products in the purchase-funnel, updates was not needed to the checkout.js file for everything to still work.

## files which is updated

- details.js
- products.js

(also minor changes (loading indicator) to details.html and store.html).

## PS

The reason it's not alot of "pushes" to this repo, is because i copied this repo before starting on this submisson. And at the end i just copied the changes made back into this repo. (should probably get more familiar with Git, since i assume thats part of whats that used for).
So all the pushes throughout this project was made to a similar "working" repo.

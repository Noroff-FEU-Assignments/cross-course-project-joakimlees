# Noroff - Cross-course project

As the title states, is this a repository to a website, from a cross course project, from my front-end development studies at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media.

The website is the result of the different course assignments combined.

The different courses was all first year courses(so far):

- Design 1
- Html and Css
- Interaction Design
- Content Management systems (CMS)

### Design 1

For the course assignment I was tasked to design a website for a brand called "rainy days", which was selling durable rain jackets, to a medium price.

We got provided a logo, but all the images used is royal free/free to use images from the web(like from: unsplash.com).

I also decided the:

- color theme
- layout
- buttons and links
- fonts
- copy
  and so on.

Course length: 5 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

### Html and Css

For the course assignment in Html and Css. I got tasked to build out the site with pure Html and Css.

Course length: 5 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length 1 week

### Interaction Design

For the course assignment in interaction design, I got tasked to make improvements to the (interaction)design, on the site. Utilizing what I further learned about UX/IxD, using html, css and javascript (javascript was a 5 week course we had previous to interaction design, but with a different project for the course assignment). (Link to my javascript course assignment)

What i did was:

- Updating the add to cart functionality
- A complete remake of the whole purchased funnel - working checkout steps
- Javascript validation on the contact form

Course length: 4 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

## Content management systems (CMS)

Instead of using the jackets-array.js a REST-API have been made using wordpress. Fetching the api using javascript.
added try catch blocks for errors and a loading indicator.

The variable names have changes slightly as the api since the structure of this rest api was different from the jackets-array previously made.
beside that the codes remaind pretty much the same.

Since i used local storage and data-attributes in interaction design CA to store and display data/products in the purchase-funnel, updates was not needed to the checkout.js file for everything to still work.

## files which is updated

- details.js
- products.js

(also minor changes (loading indicator) to details.html and store.html).

## PS

The reason it's not alot of "pushes" to this repo, is because i copied this repo before starting on this submisson. And at the end i just copied the changes made back into this repo. (should probably get more familiar with Git, since i assume thats part of whats that used for).
So all the pushes throughout this project was made to a similar "working" repo.

# Noroff - Cross-course project

## Introduction

As the title states, is this a repository to a website, from a cross course project, from my front-end development studies at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media.

The website is the result of the different course assignments combined.

The different courses was all first year courses(so far):

- Design 1
- Html and Css
- Interaction Design
- Content Management systems (CMS)

### Design 1

For the course assignment I was tasked to design a website for a brand called "rainy days", which was selling durable rain jackets, to a medium price.

We got provided a logo, but all the images used is royal free/free to use images from the web(like from: unsplash.com).

I also decided the:

- color theme
- layout
- buttons and links
- fonts
- copy
  and so on.

Course length: 5 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

### Html and Css

For the course assignment in Html and Css. I got tasked to build out the site with pure Html and Css.

Course length: 5 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length 1 week

### Interaction Design

For the course assignment in interaction design, I got tasked to make improvements to the (interaction)design, on the site. Utilizing what I further learned about UX/IxD, using html, css and javascript (javascript was a 5 week course we had previous to interaction design, but with a different project for the course assignment).

What i did was:

- Updating the add to cart functionality
- A complete remake of the whole purchased funnel - working checkout steps
- Javascript validation on the contact form

Course length: 4 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

### Content management systems (CMS)

For the CSM course assignment I was tasked to create a REST API for my products using wordpress. Fetching the data from the REST API using javascript. Using query string parameters allowing the user to click on an individual item in the product list and take them to see that product, with the specific data for that product on the page.

Previously for the site I was using an array I just created in a separate file, using vanilla javascript, for adding "products" (jackets-array.js).
So all the functionality with javascript was pretty much set.

Course length: 3 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

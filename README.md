# Noroff - Cross-course project

## Introduction

As the title states, is this a repository to a website, from a cross course project, from my front-end development studies at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media.

The website is the result of the different course assignments combined.

The different courses was all first year courses(so far):

- Design 1
- Html and Css
- Interaction Design
- Content Management systems (CMS)

### Design 1

For the course assignment I was tasked to design a website for a brand called "rainy days", which was selling durable rain jackets, to a medium price.

We got provided a logo, but all the images used is royal free/free to use images from the web(like from: unsplash.com).

Among other things, I also decided the:

- Color theme
- Layout
- Buttons and links
- Fonts
- Copy/text

Course length: 5 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

### Html and Css

For the course assignment in Html and Css. I got tasked to build out the site with pure Html and Css.

Course length: 5 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length 1 week

### Interaction Design

For the course assignment in interaction design, I got tasked to make improvements to the (interaction)design, on the site. Utilizing what I further learned about UX/IxD, using html, css and javascript (javascript was a 5 week course we had previous to interaction design, but with a different project for the course assignment).

What i did was:

- Updating the add to cart functionality
- A complete remake of the whole purchased funnel - working checkout steps
- Javascript validation on the contact form

Course length: 4 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

### Content management systems (CMS)

For the CSM course assignment I was tasked to create a REST API for my products using wordpress. Fetching the data from the REST API using javascript. Using query string parameters allowing the user to click on an individual item in the product list and take them to see that product, with the specific data for that product on the page.

Previously for the site I was using an array I just created in a separate file, using vanilla javascript, for adding "products" (jackets-array.js).
So all the functionality with javascript was pretty much set.

Course length: 3 weeks (with the last week being the course assignment)
Assignment length: 1 week

### Improvements

Here I provide a list of some improve one could add to the project:

- Add a sort, filter and working search function for different jackets
- Write better/DRY javascript for cart and purchase funnel functionality
- Make a larger and more delicate footer.
- Add actual color-indicators on the product page, instead of e checkbox
- Set a background color to make the site look more whole. (on the store page especially, the site might blend to much in with the white space on the sides).
- redesign the product cards on the store page, to make them suit the rest of the design better.

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Wordpress REST API

## Final reflection

Working on a project cross-course have been really interesting. Since you kind of think your "done" with it, at the first delivery. So having to pick up and old project and make improvements is something that kind of gives you an experience on how it is to start working on incomplete projects.

For the second delivery on this project, in the interaction design course, I made a working cart and complete purchase funnel functionality with javascript. I was lacking a bit behind on the deadline for the delivery at this point, so my focus was just to get together something that worked. Which ended up ok. My main take from this part, is that by just letting myself loose and writing something in javascript just for the purpose of it working was a lott of learning for me. Even though I know I could have written some functions for some of the code, instead of just repeating myself. But at this point in my journey, I look at it as good learning, and the most important part is that I know I normally should write more DRY, structure and organized javascript.
